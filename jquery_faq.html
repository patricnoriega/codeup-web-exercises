      <dd class="invisible">Bob Dylan is nothing but cool. </dd>

      <dt>Jeff Buckley</dt>
      <dd class="invisible">The late singer and guitarist. Pure Perfection.</dd>

      <dt>RadioHead</dt>
      <dd class="invisible">Originally called On A Friday. What more can be said about this band?</dd>

    <dt>The Smiths</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The Smiths were a great band, and Morrissey has a great solo career too. Not as great, but still good.</dd>

    <dt>Sonic Youth</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">A band very rarely heard by common people. The oldest band out there with "Youth" in the title. loud, noisy guitar squalls</dd>

    <dt>The Smashing Pumpkins</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">After listening to "Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness," I had reached the conclusion that The Smashing Pumpkins are one of the best rock bands in history.</dd>

    <dt>Pixies</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">From the first time I heard "Hey", the Pixies became my favorite band. The song "Where is My Mind" at the end of Fightclub re-kindled some interest in their style.</dd>

    <dt>Alice in Chains</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Their music is deep, poetic, dark, emotional, beautiful and just rocks. Awesome vocals from Layne Stanley.</dd>

    <dt>Nirvana</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Do yourself a favour, sober up and go to the record store. Spend ten bucks and buy them live, unplugged on MTV, and thank me.</dd>

    <dt>Sigur ros</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">The best icelandic band ever. Half of the people will find them boring, while the other half will believe in god after listening to their music.</dd>
